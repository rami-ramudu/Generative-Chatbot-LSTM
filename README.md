# Generative-Chatbot-LSTM

This is the part of project that I am currently working on,where I create two different versions of chatbot,One Retrieval based,the other one is generative chatbot

The Generative Chatbot uses LSTM to predict the sequence of words from the encoder and outputs to the decoder.I don't have any copyrights to the dataset.

The Model thus created,has an accuracy of almost 100 percent when reduced the batch size and increased the number of epochs.

To explore more,you can build on top of this model by,considering the state values of the previous questions and then make use of them,which helps in the generation of meaningful answers based on the question semantics.
